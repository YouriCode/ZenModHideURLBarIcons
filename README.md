Want to click your URL bar but surprise buttons appear at the last moment?

This mod allows you to **hide the buttons in the URL bar**, especially the ones that appear on hover! No more frustration.

## Setup

Set the buttons you want to show or hide via *Settings > Zen Mods*.

### Hidden by default
These are **hidden by default** as there are alternatives to access their menus: 
- **Bookmark** *(you can bookmark a page by right-clicking a tab/a page and by using a keyboard shortcut [default: Ctrl+D])*
- **Translate** *(you can access Translation via the main menu over the URL bar)*
- **Reader Mode** *(you can activate Reader Mode when available by using a keyboard shortcut [default: F9])*
- **Picture-In-Picture** *(PIP automatically starts when switching tab)*
- **Addon-related actions** *(you can access Addons Options via the Addons button over the URL bar)*

### Danger zone

You can also choose to hide other icons to have an URL bar only showing the URL. However, **disabling these is not recommended** as they provide safety and confidentiality information about the websites you visit:
- **Website Identity**
- **Permissions**
- **Tracking Protection**
